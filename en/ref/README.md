# 9. Reference

This section elucidates the inner workings of the Trails framework, and provides a reference for the APIs.

## [Trails API](trails.md)

This is the primary API that your application resources, such as Controllers and Services, will use to communicate with other areas of your application.

## [Trailpack API](trailpack.md)

This interface is implemented by all Trailpacks, and is relied upon by the Trails Application to harmoniously load and manage them.
